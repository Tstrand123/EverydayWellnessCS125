# Everyday Wellness

Our wellness app’s goal is to give helpful recommendations to the user regarding when they sleep, how they eat, and what exercise/physical activity they do per day in order to keep the user healthy and fit.


## Project Goals and Approach
Sleep recommendations include when to go to bed and when to wake up in order to maximize the hours the user sleeps. The app will keep track of how much the user sleeps and will continue to make recommendations that work for the user as the user uses the app more. We will develop our own algorithm that will work with the data and come up with a result that best fits the user based on the logic we are continuously researching.

The food recommendations goal is to get the user to eat a balanced diet everyday within their recommended calorie intake.The user will log the food they eat along with how many calories and what food category the meal is a part of. Then the app will recommend users to have meals that include food categories that they haven’t eaten yet, as well as recommend some general foods that fit those categories. We plan on using machine learning to make meaningful recommendations. We aren’t sure what model we might use, but we are currently researching different models that will fit our needs.

The app will also track the user’s activity level and ensure the user is getting their 30 minutes of physical activity per day. The app will check the user’s heart rate as well as steps taken to see if they have been active. The user will also have the option to manually implement what activity they have done as well as how long they did it. We will develop an algorithm that will heavily rely on ensuring 30 minutes of activity per day. So, it will take in data and analyze the data to determine the best course of action for the user.

The lifestyle score will be an overall health score (over an average of 7 days) that visually shows the user how well they are doing in terms of being healthy and fit. Right now, the plan is that each section (food, sleep, and exercise) is given a certain amount of points. If, for example, the user goes to bed at the right time and wakes up at the right time, then they will get points for following our recommendation. Same applies to eating and exercise recommendations. The lifestyle score will add all the points together and will be displayed to the user to show their progress.
